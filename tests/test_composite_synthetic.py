    lambda values that don't correspond to any real detector's per-pixel
    count scale.

    `reference` lets the caller anchor the scale to a specific feature
    (e.g. the TS peak height) instead of the curve's raw global maximum.
    This matters for BG_TS_GP curves: the low-q Guinier-Porod forward-
    scattering upturn is routinely ~100x taller than the actual TS peak,
    so scaling off `np.max(I_true)` would starve the peak/background
    regions of counts regardless of how large `exposure_level` is —
    found via a real recovery-rate debugging session, not a hypothetical.

    The returned floor is a small FRACTION of `peak` (not an absolute
    near-machine-epsilon constant like the callers used to clip to
    externally): at low exposure, most high-q pixels get exactly 0
    Poisson counts while scattered pixels get 1 count -- rescaled, that's
    a jump from 0 straight to a nonzero value comparable to `peak`'s own
    scale. Clipping the zero-count pixels to an absolute 1e-6 floor (many
    orders of magnitude below any real feature here) created a spurious,
    enormous apparent intensity swing between adjacent points once
    residual_mode="log10" (v2 §1's a.u.-default) started taking log10 of
    these values directly -- detect_high_q_cut and guess_class both
