<h1>PRISM — quick-start guide</h1>

<p><b>The flow:</b> bring data in through the <b>Library</b>, then switch to the
workspace for your technique in the left rail. Everything you derive
(baseline-subtracted, combined, fitted) lands back in the Library as a new
spectrum. <b>File &rsaquo; Save project</b> keeps the whole session in one
<code>.prism</code> file (older project files still load).</p>

<h2>Library</h2>
<p><b>Import files…</b> auto-detects the format (plain XY, TA SDT thermal exports,
SAXS EDF, Rigaku <code>.rasx</code>, JCAMP-DX). If it guesses wrong, use
<b>Custom import…</b> (Ctrl+I) to pick the parser and the X/Y columns yourself, with a
preview. Right-click spectra to rename, duplicate, reorder, export as text
(Ctrl+E), combine (sum / average / weighted subtraction), or delete.
<b>Undo (Ctrl+Z)</b> steps back through library changes: deletes, renames,
duplicates, combine results, applied baselines, and accepted mineral IDs.</p>

<h2>Baseline</h2>
<p>Pick a method — <b>arPLS</b> is the automatic default; polynomial / spline /
rubberband fit <i>through regions you choose</i>. Type regions like
<code>100-400; 1800-2600</code> or toggle <b>Add region by dragging</b> and sweep them
on the plot. <b>Preview</b> shows raw + baseline + subtracted; <b>Apply</b> creates a
<code>_bl</code> spectrum.</p>
<p><b>Tip for glasses:</b> broad bands need a stiff arPLS — use λ around
<b>1e7</b>. At the usual 1e5 the baseline eats the band itself. (Verified against
the ISG pressure series: λ=1e7 beat a hand-drawn baseline.)</p>

<h2>Raman (Simple Plot)</h2>
<p>Multi-select spectra to overlay them: separate panels or stacked with an
offset. Load CIF files to overlay predicted Bragg positions (managed per-CIF:
color, label, visibility). Difference mode shows A−B for exactly two selected
spectra. Toggle <b>Annotate on click</b> to pin peak-position labels.</p>

<h2>Peak Fitting</h2>
<p>Set up components three ways: in the <b>Fit param.</b> table, with
<b>Auto-find peaks</b> (its <i>detection limit</i> spinner sets how strong a
candidate must be, in units of the noise — lower it to catch weak peaks), or
with <b>Pick peaks on plot</b> — toggle it and click each peak apex.
Then <b>Fit&nbsp;!</b>. Shapes: G (Gaussian), GL (pseudo-Voigt), V (true Voigt),
EMG (asymmetric, signed skew). The <code>FWHM=#</code> column links a component's
width to another's, and the <b>Name</b> column labels a component (e.g.
"ν1 PO4") — names follow into the legend, reports, and CSV exports.
Reports include R², ±1σ errors, and peak centroids;
<b>Conf. intervals</b> runs rigorous F-test profiling. Save a configuration as a
<i>model</i> to reuse it — models are also the recipes <b>Multi-Fit</b> applies
across many spectra at once.</p>
<p><b>Origin-like mode</b> is a faithful stepwise Levenberg-Marquardt:
<i>1 iteration</i> performs exactly one damped parameter update (watch the
curve move), and <i>Fit until converged</i> repeats until the relative χ²
change drops below the tolerance — the same behavior as Origin's NLFit
dialog.</p>
<p><b>Width convention:</b> the "FWHM" fields have always been <i>half</i>-widths
(HWHM) — a historical convention kept so old saved models stay valid. Double
them when quoting true FWHM.</p>

<h2>XAS</h2>
<p>Import EasyXAFS ZIPs, CSVs, or Athena <code>.prj</code> from the workspace's own
buttons. Tabs follow the workflow: Pre-processing (smoothing, Bragg
angle→energy correction, click-based tie-point alignment) → μ(E) Builder
(with deglitching) → Normalization / EXAFS (Larch) → Analysis (average or sum
repeat scans, difference, linear-combination fitting, PCA species count) →
Export (Athena formats). Importing an Athena <code>.prj</code> needs no Larch.</p>

<h2>DTA / Thermal</h2>
<p>Pick X/Y/dY channels, compute Tg three ways (double tangent, parallel
tangent, |dY| max) — the result panel says whether the methods agree.
"Calculs" integrates or finds extrema over a range; Batch processes a folder.</p>

<h2>Raman ID (RRUFF)</h2>
<p>Auto-find (or type) your spectrum's peak positions, then <b>Find matches</b>:
candidates are ranked by peak overlap, each showing its <b>laser wavelength</b> —
relative intensities vary between wavelengths, so judge the overlay yourself.
The <b>Database filters</b> restrict candidates before ranking: laser λ
(matched ±2 nm, so 532 also covers 532.6), oriented/unoriented, high-res vs
broad-scan, and quality category. Shift/Ctrl-click several result rows to
overlay multiple references at once.
Nothing is labeled until you click <b>Accept</b> — and Accept works
iteratively for mixtures: the accepted phase is recorded, the peaks it
explains are removed from the query, and the table immediately shows matches
for the REMAINING peaks (already-accepted references are excluded). Repeat
until every peak is explained; each accept is one Ctrl+Z away. One more click
overlays the matched mineral's predicted XRD pattern (AMCSD structure) in
the Raman workspace (needs the AMCSD download below).
<b>Download RRUFF database…</b> / <b>Download AMCSD structures…</b> fetch
and index those databases directly from rruff.net — no Python needed, runs
in the background, safe to re-run if interrupted.</p>

<h2>HT-XRD</h2>
<p>Import a whole folder of patterns; temperatures come from <code>.rasx</code>
metadata or a filename template like <code>scan_???.xy</code>. The waterfall is
colored by temperature. The <b>Maps</b> tab adds a 2D heatmap
(linear/log/sqrt/power color scales), a difference map or difference waterfall
vs a reference pattern ("first", an index, or a temperature), a 3D surface,
an optional time axis from the heating rate, and dashed peak-guide lines
(<code>{slice:2θ; slice:2θ}</code> anchors, interpolated).</p>
<p><b>Tracking</b>, three ways. (1) <b>Pick track guide</b> on the waterfall:
click the same peak at two (or more) temperatures — bottom and top, say — then
<b>Track picked guide</b> follows the peak along that line; one click from an
intermediate temperature also works for a peak that appears or dies.
(2) <b>Auto-track all peaks</b> finds every peak of the first pattern and
tracks them all (the generated windows appear in the field for editing).
(3) Typed windows — <code>28.5-29.5 @ 28.98; 31-32</code> — where the
<code>@</code> anchor picks WHICH peak to track when a window holds more than
one. In every mode the fit is seeded from the previous pattern (so it follows
a drifting peak instead of jumping to a stronger neighbor), and a peak weaker
than the <i>Absence σ</i> noise threshold is reported as absent instead of a
garbage fit — vanished/appeared peaks are flagged as transition signatures
alongside fit-quality anomalies.</p>

<h2>Clustering</h2>
<p>Select a series (e.g. a multi-point map), choose KMeans or hierarchical and
a cluster count: PCA scatter colored by cluster, per-cluster mean spectra, and
an assignment table.</p>

<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>Every spectrum operation in one place. Between spectra: add, subtract,
multiply, divide, average, weighted sum, and <b>modulated addition</b>
(A + w(x)·B with a constant / linear-ramp / Gaussian envelope). Per
spectrum: scale/offset, normalizations (max, area, min-max), log/ln/exp/√/
power/reciprocal/|y|, x-shift and x-scale calibration, crop, resample,
smoothing (Savitzky-Golay, moving average, median), cosmic-ray despiking,
Savitzky-Golay derivatives, cumulative integral. Analysis:
<b>linear-combination fitting</b> (target ≈ Σ cᵢ·refᵢ, free or non-negative
coefficients, with R² and percentages) and summary statistics.
<i>Selection order matters</i>: the first-selected spectrum is A (or the LCF
target). Preview shows inputs faint + result bold; Apply adds derived
spectra to the Library (undoable).</p>

<h2>XRD ID</h2>
<p>QualX-style phase identification against YOUR OWN card databases —
PRISM ships none. Download any database you have the rights to use (any
QualX-format .sq works) and register it with <b>Add database…</b> (or
<b>Add folder…</b> for several at once): a QualX-format file is indexed
once locally; a PRISM-format .sq (e.g. shared by a colleague) is used in
place. Check any number of registered databases to probe them all in one
search — every card keeps its source and code, and results say which
database each hit came from.
Auto-find (or type) the pattern's 2θ peaks, set λ and the match tolerance,
optionally restrict by chemistry (must-contain / must-exclude elements) or
source, then <b>Search match</b>: candidates ranked by figure of merit
(intensity-weighted coverage both ways), previewed as stick patterns under
the query (shift/ctrl-click to compare several). <b>Accept</b> is iterative
for mixtures, exactly like Raman ID: the phase is recorded, its peaks
leave the query, the rest is re-searched; Ctrl+Z undoes.
<b>Check Raman-identified phases here</b> overlays the XRD reference lines
of every phase accepted in Raman ID — the Raman→XRD cross-check in one
click. The Card browser tab looks up any card by name/mineral/formula.</p>

<h2>Figures</h2>
<p>Publication-figure building (the Origin-inspired module). <b>XY builder</b>:
stack library spectra as layers — per-layer plot type (line, scatter,
line+symbols, sticks, filled area, bars, steps), color, vertical offset, and
multi-panel assignment — with Publication/Presentation/Poster style presets,
log axes, and export at exact centimeter size and dpi (PNG/SVG/PDF/TIFF).
<b>Point fitting</b>: Origin's classic models (linear, polynomials,
exponential decay/growth, power law, logarithmic, Boltzmann sigmoid,
Gaussian, Lorentzian, Arrhenius) with parameters ±1σ and R².
<b>Ternary</b>: barycentric composition plots from a CSV table, optional
color-mapped value column. <b>Raman ↔ XRD</b>: the cross-technique figure —
your Raman spectrum with its accepted Mineral-ID phases above the XRD
pattern with each accepted phase's reference stick pattern.</p>

<h2>SAXS/WAXS</h2>
<p>Small/wide-angle scattering (ported from the author's own POMME suite).
Import Xenocs-style 1D ASCII curves; <b>Reduction</b> subtracts the empty
capillary with manual, auto, transmission, or physics-based (xraydb)
scaling; <b>Analysis</b> fits Guinier (Rg), generalized Porod (slope +
background), and pseudo-Bragg peaks (d-spacing, correlation length) with
auto region detection; <b>WAXS</b> auto-finds and fits pseudo-Voigt peaks
(d-spacings, crystallinity index). Curves can be sent to the Library.
The XAS workspace also gained a <b>Sample mass</b> tab — the Hephaestus
calculator on oxide compositions (mol%/wt%) or formulas: masses for total
μt = 1 / 2.5 and edge step Δμt = 1 in a pellet of chosen diameter.</p>

<h2>Glass</h2>
<p>Composition-based glass property calculation. Paste (or load as CSV) a
composition table &mdash; header = oxides, one row per sample, mol% or wt% &mdash;
then: <b>Optical basicity &Lambda;</b> (oxygen-weighted Duffy mixing with the
recommended per-oxide values of Rodriguez &amp; McCloy, PNNL-20184 Table B.1),
and <b>GlassNet predictions</b> (Tg, viscosity, density, refractive index and
~80 more; Cassar 2023, trained on SciGlass &mdash; estimates to validate, not
measurements). Compare against SciGlass, INTERGLAD, glassproperties.com.</p>
