"""Raw 2D EDF (ESRF Data Format) frame ingestion via pyFAI.

Built against a Xenocs Xeuss Pro: a BEAMSTOPLESS SAXS/WAXS/GISAXS/USAXS
instrument. There is no physical beamstop -- the direct beam is deliberately
co-recorded on the same detector frame as the sample scattering, giving
extended low-q access and letting the instrument's own software (XSACT Pro)
derive transmission directly from that recorded direct-beam spot rather than
from a separate diode. This explains why ``TransmittedFlux``/``Intensity1``/
``pilai0``/``pilct0``/``pilroi0`` all read the same quantity in every frame
checked, and why ``Monitor``/``mon`` are always 0 (no separate monitor
hardware is used in this design).

For instruments whose control software already writes a calibrated beam
center / sample distance / wavelength into each frame's own header (true
here), so no per-batch geometry refinement is required -- callers who want
extra rigor can still validate the embedded geometry against an AgBeh
calibration frame (see ``validate_against_agbeh``).

Produces a properly-normalized :class:`~saxs_core.curve.Curve` that feeds
into the *existing* :mod:`saxs_core.reduction` empty-subtraction pipeline
unchanged -- this module only replaces how a 1D curve is obtained from a raw
frame, not how two 1D curves get combined.

Geometry axis convention (validated against a real AgBeh calibration frame:
integrated first-order ring at q=0.1077 vs the literature 0.10763 A^-1 for
silver behenate, second order at 0.2152 vs 0.2153 -- not assumed, checked):

    poni1 = Center_2 * pixel_size   (array axis 0, "Dim_2" in the EDF header)
    poni2 = Center_1 * pixel_size   (array axis 1, "Dim_1" in the EDF header)

Normalization convention: historically-produced 1D reductions of this data
divided a sample's own integrated signal by that sample's own transmitted
flux, which inflates strongly-absorbing samples -- confirmed directly
against raw pixel counts: a highly-absorbing sample shows LOWER raw counts
than a weakly-absorbing one (as physically expected), the opposite of what
those historical 1D files showed. So intensities here are normalized by
exposure time only (a genuine count rate, unaffected by absorption);
``curve.transmission`` carries the frame's own TransmittedFlux for later use
-- ``saxs_core.reduction.correct_sample``'s existing "transmission" scale
mode already applies that ratio only to the empty side of a subtraction,
which is the physically correct place for it. This normalization fix is
independent of the beamstopless-specific caveat below and holds across the
whole accessible q-range.

KNOWN LIMITATION of this module: it integrates the full azimuth and masks a
fixed disc of 28 px around the beam (``direct_beam_mask``), so nothing below
q ~ 0.0095 A^-1 at this geometry comes out of it. The reason the near-beam
region looked unrecoverable was understood later (September 2026): for
absorbing powders in capillaries the part of the beam that passes next to the
capillary walls is refracted outward and lands as two lobes on the horizontal
detector axis, and the slit-scattering streaks run along both axes; the
azimuthal average of these features is a spurious low-q maximum, and the
frame-derived transmission of a region-of-interest that contains the lobes is
wrong. The remedy is geometric, not a vendor procedure: see
:mod:`saxs.core.edf_sectors`, which integrates the four diagonal wedges of
the frame, masks the lobe zone, takes the transmission from the recorded
direct beam averaged over the beam footprint, and subtracts the empty of the
same session. New work should use that module; this one is kept for the
full-azimuth integration and the AgBeh geometry check.

pyFAI and fabio are optional at import time (matching the sasmodels/bumps
pattern in ``saxs_core.modelfit``) so the rest of the suite works without
them.
