"""
saxs.core — the SAXS/WAXS science engine, ported from the author's own
'pomme' project (github.com/sams808/pomme) into PRISM as the SAXS/WAXS
module. Framework-agnostic: Curve model with provenance, Xenocs-style 1D
ASCII loader, physics-based empty/background reduction (xraydb),
Guinier/Porod/peak/unified analysis, WAXS multi-peak fitting, and the
composite-model staged-fitting pipeline (component library, presets,
staged fit, batch runner).

Re-exports the names qt_saxs.py (and most other external callers) need,
so `from saxs.core import Curve, load_curve, fit_staged, ...` works
without reaching into individual submodules.
