"""
saxs_core/composite_staged.py — the staged, reproducible fitting pipeline
(spec §4, stages 0-4 in this file; stages 5-6 diagnostics/model-selection
follow in a later pass). General-purpose: works on ANY 1D SAXS Curve, not
tied to a specific sample series or naming scheme — `sample_id` is just an
arbitrary string used to seed the deterministic multistart RNG and to label
the result; callers can pass a filename, a UUID, or anything else.

Stage sequence (spec §4.2):
  0  hygiene: trim, sigma model, auto-window proposal, class guess (a/b/c)
  1  fit BG (flat_background + power_law) on W_hiq only; freeze pl_B/pl_p
  2  add teubner_strey, seeded from the peak window; fit TS+bg_C on
     W_peak ∪ W_hiq (pl_B/pl_p stay frozen); a class-a guardrail (pulled
     forward from spec's own Stage 6 rule) rejects a TS fit that isn't
     actually significant, falling back to BG alone for that sample
  3  add guinier_porod for a low-q upturn; fit GP+bg_C on W_loq with
     TS/pl frozen
  4  global: release ALL parameters with widened bounds around the
     stage 1-3 best-fit values, multistart (deterministic, seeded from
     sample_id), keep the lowest reduced chi-square

The pipeline never raises on a shoulder-only or featureless profile — a
failed later stage simply falls back to the best composite assembled so
far, and the function still returns a valid FitResult.
